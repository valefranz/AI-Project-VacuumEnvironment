AI-Project-VacuumEnvironment
============================

An environment to test a vacuum agent, created for the university project of Prof. Milani's Artificial Intelligence course at Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Perugia, and inspired from a problem posed by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig in the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".

## Dependencies

You must have [kivy](http://kivy.org/#home) installed on your system.

* [Download Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download)
* [Install Kivy on Windows](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html)
* [Install kivy on Mac](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-osx.html)
* note that Kivi dependencies installation command for Windows installation (the one on the official guide page) can give problems: to solve, just put the two commands in a single line, deleting the separation backslash between the two, which is only for visualization purposes 

## Run the application

If you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the program with:
```bash
# To open the GUI with max 2 Agent (old program)
python aima-ui-2a.py

# To open the GUI with 4 Agent
python aima-ui-4a.py
```

## Add an Agent

You can write your own agent and add it to the environment. The procedure is simply, you have to follow these steps:

* Create a file in `agent_dir`, for example named `MyNewAgent.py`
* Add a class named like the file and ended with `Class`. In this example will be `MyNewAgentClass`
* Your class have to inherit from `Agent` class
* Insert your class in the list of imported module in `agent_dir/__init__.py`

Below we have an example `MyAgent.py` with some useful details:

```python
from . agents import *


class MyNewAgentClass(Agent):

    def __init__(self, x=2, y=2):
        Agent.__init__(self)

        ##
        # Personalize the identifier of this class.
        # Will be used instead of the class name
        # in neighbours info
        self.name = 'ExampleAgent'

        def program(status, bump, neighbors):
            """Main function of the Agent.

            Params:
                status (string): 'Dirty' or 'Clean'
                bump (string): 'Bump' or 'None'
                neighbors (list of tuples): [
                        ( (agent_id, agent_type), (r_x, r_y) ),
                        ...,
                        ...
                    ]

            Returns:
                 (string): one of these commands:
                            - 'Suck'
                            - 'GoNorth'
                            - 'GoSouth'
                            - 'GoWest'
                            - 'GoEast'
                            - 'NoOp' or 'Noop'

            """
            ##
            # id is assigned by the environment
            # in aima-ui-4a
            print(self.id)
            print(status, bump, neighbors)

            return 'NoOp'


        self.program = program

```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, so please feel free to fix bugs, improve things, provide documentation. 
For anything submit a personal message or fork the project to make a pull request and so on... thanks!

## Notes

This library is under development, so there may be substantial changes and improvements in the near future.

This project is based on [aima-python](https://code.google.com/p/aima-python/) for a course of artificial intelligence. In particular, these modules have been modified to meet the new specifications:

* Environment
* Agent
* utils
